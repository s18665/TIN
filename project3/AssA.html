        <h2>History of Netflix</h2>
        <p>
            Netflix was founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph two software engineers who previously worked at Full Software,
            created a company based on two ideas they got from their experiences.
            <aside class="pquote">
                <blockquote>
        <p> Netflix was founded in 1997</p>
        </blockquote>
        </aside>

            The very first logo Netflix’s had when they started off was a very generic black text logo with the title Netflix.com
            with the Netflix logo split into “Net” and “Flix” with a circle spiral in the shape of a film reel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Randolph who had an interest in the internet wanted to start an internet business but didn’t know what type of product to s
            ell and Hastings who saw how retailers were charging people for renting movies, was disgusted by their practices and wanted to make renting more consumer friendly.
            <img class="img_in_text" src="1.png" alt="oldest logo" >
            Looking at the logo, it’s clear the logo wasn’t a good representation of their company and meaning is besides being movie/TV show Rental Company. The logo is just simple black text with the word split in half to try making
            it appealing for those who can recognize it, the company and its meaning. The only thing that can show the company’s meaning is the film reel but even that isn’t enough
        </p>
        <p>
            These two interests Randolph and Hastings had, lead them to the finding/creation of Netflix as a monthly movie rental service where people could go online (started off with traditional mailing
            before the popularity of email) and rent movies or tv shows with good rental fees and Netflix would send the movies directly to the consumers by mail.
            <img class="img_in_text" src="2.png" alt="2nd oldest logo" >
            The Netflix Second Logo Design has a red background and a white font and black stroke with the font. The font design in the Netflix logo appears to be “Graphique”
            as the logo has a thick design on the right side of the text/letters giving it a 3D look to make it stand out.
        </p>
        <p>
            They kept the business model from 1999 till 2007 when they dropped the business model in favor of streaming films and tv shows. Netflix would introduce their “Video on Demand” streaming serv
            ice using their brand name for on-demand streaming services and became one of the most successful Videos on Demand out there.
            <aside class="pquote">
                <blockquote>
        <p> from 1999 till 2007</p>
        </blockquote>
        </aside>
            The bottom of the logo has a semi-circle curve as the N and X are longer but the text becomes a bit shorter until it reaches the middle letter F.
            The idea for the curve could have been taken the previous logo where the curved used for the film reel to split the Netflix word.
        </p>
        <p>
            Marc Randolph was the first CEO of Netflix since it’s findings in 1997 until 2004
            when he left the company. Reed Hastings took over as the CEO from 2004 and still holding the title to this day.
            The Thrid Logo drops the White and Black “Graphique” font and went for a different font and used it’s trademark red color as the Font’s color. With that color, the red background was dropped in favor of a white and/or transparent background. But the semi-circle curve on the bottom was still kept for the next logo.
