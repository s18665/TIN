    <div class="article">
        Krawczyk learned to play the guitar on his own, whereas his vocal abilities were practised when he attended secondary school of music in Łódź.
        However, he had to quit his musical studies and become an errand-boy, because his father, an actor, died and his mother suffered from depression.
        He was the only member of the family to earn a living.
        In 1963 he founded, together with Ryszard Poznakowski, Marian Lichtman, Sławomir Kowalewski and Halina Żytkowiak, one of the best known Polish beat music bands
        of the 1960s, Trubadurzy, who combined elements of rock with Polish folk music.
